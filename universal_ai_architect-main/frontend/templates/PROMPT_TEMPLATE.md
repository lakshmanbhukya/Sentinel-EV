# 📝 Master Prompt Template (For Coding IDE)

**Objective:** This template is used by the Architect to generate the `START_HERE_PROMPT.md` for the specific project.

## [ARCHITECT: USE THE CONTENT BELOW TO GENERATE THE PROJECT PROMPT]

**Role:** You are an expert Full-Stack "Applied AI" Engineer. Your goal is to build a high-fidelity, production-ready dashboard based on the provided screenshot and project context using React + Vite.

### 📂 Step 1: Initialize Context

Before writing any code, you **MUST** read the following context files located in the `.brainchain/` directory:

1. **`data-model.md`**: To understand the variables, schemas, and data relationships.
2. **`design-tokens.md`**: To get the exact hex codes, spacing, and typography rules.
3. **`ui-inventory.md`**: To see the full list of components required.
4. **`project-requirements.md`**: To review the specific feature priorities and user roles.

### 📋 Step 2: Global Rules & Standards

You must strictly adhere to the following universal standards (located in the Universal Repo):

* **Code Quality:** Refer to `framework-rules.md` (React + Vite, React Router, Tailwind, Shadcn/UI).
* **Accessibility:** Refer to `accessibility-std.md` (WCAG compliance, semantic HTML).
* **UX Layout:** Refer to `dashboard-patterns.md` (F-pattern hierarchy, KPI placement).

### 🛠️ Step 3: Execution Plan

1. **Phase 1 (The Foundation):** Generate the `App.tsx` with React Router setup and the primary Navigation/Sidebar shell.
2. **Phase 2 (The Layout):** Create the main dashboard grid based on the screenshot's visual hierarchy.
3. **Phase 3 (The Components):** Build individual widgets (KPI cards, charts, tables) using mock data that follows the `data-model.md`.
4. **Phase 4 (The Polish):** Apply the "Applied AI" magic—add subtle animations (Framer Motion), loading skeletons, and hover states.

### 🚨 Constraints

* **Visual Fidelity:** The layout must be a pixel-perfect match to the attached screenshot.
* **No Hallucinations:** Use only the technologies specified in `framework-rules.md`.
* **Clean Code:** Export reusable components into the `src/components` directory.
* **Client-Side Rendering:** All components render on the client using React hooks for state and data fetching.

**"Read the context, look at the image, and let's build something world-class. Ready to start with Phase 1?"**

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### Key Conceptual Changes
- **Framework:** Template now generates prompts for React + Vite instead of Next.js
- **Entry Point:** Instructions focus on `App.tsx` with React Router instead of `layout.tsx`
- **Architecture:** Emphasizes client-side rendering and explicit data fetching patterns
- **Directory Structure:** References `src/components` instead of `@/components` alias

### Tradeoffs vs Next.js
- **Lost:** Server-side rendering capabilities, automatic routing, built-in API integration
- **Gained:** Faster development experience, explicit control over application architecture, simpler mental model
- **Changed:** Requires manual routing setup, separate backend for API functionality, explicit state management

### When Next.js Would Still Be Better
- Projects requiring SEO optimization through server-side rendering
- Applications needing rapid prototyping with built-in API routes
- Teams preferring file-based routing conventions
- Complex applications requiring advanced performance optimizations
